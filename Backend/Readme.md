# 🎬 YouTube + Twitter Backend

YouStreamPro Backend is the core server-side engine for a powerful and scalable video streaming platform, inspired by YouTube. Designed with modularity, performance, and security in mind, this backend system handles everything from user management to video uploads, playlists, subscriptions, analytics, and even micro-social features like tweets and comments.

Built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, it provides a robust RESTful API layer that connects seamlessly with the frontend, supports cloud storage (Cloudinary), and implements industry-standard best practices for authentication, validation, and error handling.
